# Contributing to meteospain

This outlines how to propose a change to meteospain. 

## Bigger changes

If you want to make a bigger change, it's a good idea to first file an issue and make sure someone from the team agrees that it’s needed. 
If you’ve found a bug, please file an issue that illustrates the bug with a minimal 
[reprex](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex) (this will also help you write a unit test, if needed).

### Pull request process

*   Fork the package and clone onto your computer. If you haven't done this before, we recommend using `usethis::create_from_github("emf-creaf/meteospain", fork = TRUE)`.

*   Install all development dependences with `devtools::install_dev_deps()`, and then make sure the package passes R CMD check by running `devtools::check()`. 
    If R CMD check doesn't pass cleanly, it's a good idea to ask for help before continuing. 

*   For passing tests and building vignettes, you will need API keys for AEMET and MeteoCat (see `?services_options`). A workaround to develop without those keys is setting the `NOT_CRAN` environment variable to `false` (`Sys.setenv(NOT_CRAN = 'false')`), but with this, most of the tests and examples will be not run when building, testing and checking.

*   Create a Git branch for your pull request (PR). We recommend using `usethis::pr_init("brief-description-of-change")`.

*   Make your changes, commit to git, and then create a PR by running `usethis::pr_push()`, and following the prompts in your browser.
    The title of your PR should briefly describe the change.
    The body of your PR should contain `Fixes #issue-number`.

*  For user-facing changes, add a bullet to the top of `NEWS.md` (i.e. just below the first header). Follow the style described in <https://style.tidyverse.org/news.html>.

### Code style

*  We use [roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/package=roxygen2), with [Markdown syntax](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/rd-formatting.html), for documentation.  

*  We use [testthat](https://cran.r-project.org/package=testthat) for unit tests. 
   Contributions with test cases included are easier to accept.  

### Dependencies

Any interaction with a meteorological API must be done with `httr` and/or `jsonlite` and/or `xml2`, as they are already dependencies of `meteospain`. See DESCRIPTION file for a list of available dependencies.

## Service code guide

When adding a new service to `meteospain`, there are some conventions to follow:

### Helpers

Each service has an R file associated, `[service_name]_helpers.R`. In this file we will put all
helpers needed to access the service API:

  - `.create_[service]_path(api_options)`: to build the vector with the path, usually depending on
  the temporal resolution.
  
  - `.create_[service]_query(api_options)`: some APIs need the parameters supplied as queries.
  
  - `.check_status_[service](api_options)`: logic to check the response statuses (200, 429,
  500...).
  
  - `.get_info_[service](api_options)`: Access, transform and return the stations info and
  metadata.
  
  - `.get_data_[service](api_options)`: Access, transform and return the data based on the
  api options provided (temporal resolution, stations...). This function will use the
  `.create_*` and `.check_status_[service]` helpers.
  

Data must be transformed to sf, adding the stations metadata. Numerical data must be converted
to units and variables names standardized among all services.

### Options

Each service must have a dedicated function to create the API options, `[service]_options`.
This function will control which parameters are needed:

  - `resolution`: Temporal resolution for the data (hourly, daily...), used to build paths,
  queries...
  - `start_date`: Starting date for the desired data, used to build paths, queries.... If
  the API only accepts one date (see MeteoCat for example), use this one.
  - `end_date`: End date for the desired data, used to build paths, queries.... If the API
  only accepts one date, this argument is not necessary.
  - `stations`: Character vector with stations IDs to use in paths or queries before retrieving
  the data or filters after.

  > NOTE: When the API only accepts one station when querying by stations, but there is a path
  to obtain all stations, this one must be used and the desired stations filtered afterwards.
  This way we reduce the calls to the API, as we dont need to create a loop to return every
  station in `stations` argument. If no path exists for getting data from all stations, then
  a loop should be used.

  - `api_key`: If the API needs a key, add this argument for the user to supply the key.
  
  > NOTE: `meteospain` does not store or encrypt in any way the supplied key. Is the user
  responsability to manage their keys. We recommend the keyring package for this in all
  docs and functions help.

### Tests

`tests/testthat/test-concordance_between_services.R` adds tests for joining data between
services.

`tests/testthat/test-[service].R` adds tests for each service.

In `utils.R` there is a helper function for the main test battery applied to each service:
`main_test_battery()`. See examples of use in the test files of services already implemented.
